# what is instance types ?
   General purpose - balanced cpu, memory, and networking e.g. (t3, m5)

   compute optimized - high performence cpu for processing tasks  e.g. (c5, c6g)

   memory optimized - large ram for databases and  caching  e.g. (r5, x1e) 

   storage optimized - high speed storage for big data e.g. (i3, d2)

   Accelerated computing - GPUs and FPGAs for AI/ML e.g. (p3,G4)
